# LNN-GKO
Long-Horizon Spatiotemporal Thermal Propagation for Metallic Additive Manufacturing: A Data-Driven Geometry-Aware Liquid Neural Algorithm
The algorithms and training scripts used in this work are provided in the LNN-GKO, RNN-GKO, and Vanilla GNN code directories. The result_plot directory contains the plotting scripts for reproducing the figures and results. To generate the plots, users need to select the appropriate model checkpoint (.pth file), dataset, and corresponding layer number.
